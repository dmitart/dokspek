== Passing tests ==

{{test name="assert-true"}}
assert true
{{/test}}

== Failing tests ==

A test that fails with an exception

{{test name="list-sum"}}
def list = [1, 2, 3]

assert list.sump() == 6
{{/test}}

A power assert failure example:

{{test name="power-assert"}}
def listOne = [1, 2, 3]
def expected = [2]

assert listOne.findAll { it % 2 } == expected
{{/test}}

== A test that should be run... or not! ==

{{test name="not-to-be-run" run="false"}}
throw "Don't run me!"
{{/test}}

{{test name="should-be-run" run="true"}}
"Run me!"
{{/test}}

== An exception is expected ==

Here, an IOException is expected:

{{test name="an-exception" throws="java.io.IOException"}}
throw new IOException("kaboom")
{{/test}}

But here, a java.io.Exception was expected, but an UnsupportedOperationException is thrown:

{{test name="different-exception" throws="java.io.IOException"}}
throw new UnsupportedOperationException()
{{/test}}

== Assert that something shouldn't compile ==

This script shouldn't compile:

{{test name="not-compilable" compiles="false"}}
if foo
{{/test}}

== Tests spanning several snippets ==

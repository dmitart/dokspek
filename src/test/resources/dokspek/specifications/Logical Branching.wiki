= Logical Branching =

The execution of your code can take different paths, depending on some conditions. Groovy supports the usual ##if## / ##else## syntax for your logical branching needs, which is very familiar in C-based languages.

In the following example, we execute the block of code delimited by the curly braces conditionally depending on the outcome of the comparison inside the parentheses of the ##if##.

{{test name="simple-if"}}
def result

def color = "green"

if (color == "green") {
    result = "color is green"
}

assert result == "color is green"
{{/test}}

Despite often being considered bad style, when only one instruction is to be conditionally executed, the parentheses can also be dropped:

{{test name="if-dropped-parens"}}
def result = "bad at math"

if (2 * 3 == 6)
    result = "I'm good at math"

assert result == "I'm good at math"
{{/test}}

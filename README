Dokspek is an executable specification documentation system.
It is a small library that parses wiki documents, extracts snippets of code to execute them as JUnit tests, and then render the wiki document into HTML pages.

Dokspek is using the XWiki Rendering engine for parsing wiki markup and producing HTML output.
